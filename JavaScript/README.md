# CountdownJS
> The JavaScript version of Countdown

## Project approach

The intention for this project was to improve my development process of a JavaScript App with a clear Test Driven Development.

## Installation

After you have run `git clone` on the parent repo, change folders into JavaScript
```
cd JavaScript
```

## Testing framework

This app was developed with the [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework. The tests can be run with the command
```
open SpecRunner.html
```
The full testing suite can be found in the `spec` folder
